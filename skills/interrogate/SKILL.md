# Interrogate

Adversaries try to break a change or a design. A finding survives only when a run proves it. Report the findings. Do not apply fixes.

## Frame

The scope is what the user names. Otherwise it is the branch diff from its merge base with the base branch, through the working tree. State the intent with the **in-your-own-words** skill, from the user's message, the commits, and the PR description. Ask the user when the intent is unclear.

**Harness profile.** Read the active profile before harness-dependent work; `profile` is absolute, or relative to `profile-root` (`plugin` means the installed plugin root), and a parent passes its child the resolved absolute path; stop the affected action if the profile is unavailable. Pass the active `harness=` and absolute `profile=` paths in every adversary prompt so each child can read the profile itself.

## Fan out

Run Phase A steps 3 and 4 and Phase B of the **arena** skill, with these changes. Read the `interrogate reviewers` line in place of `arena runners`. Copy the scope's uncommitted changes into each worktree. Spawn each adversary through the profile's reviewer role, using the tool and arguments its Subagents section names. It may write repros only in its own worktree and never edits the reviewed change. Where the profile supports no parallel spawn, run the adversaries sequentially and disclose the reduced independence in the reply and trail. Where it supports no spawn, run each adversary yourself in sequence and disclose the same. In place of the arena task and rationale, give each adversary the scope, the intent, and this brief:

> Break this change. Prove each finding with a run against the real code, such as a failing test, a repro script, or command output that shows the wrong behavior. For a design or plan, run a prototype or probe the current tree. Keep repros in your own worktree. Report each finding with a title, the exact command, the output it printed, and the output the intent requires. Leave out anything you did not run. That covers style, naming, structure, and risks that need a future change to matter. No findings is a valid result.

Arena's candidate-selection gate does not apply because adversaries do not author candidates for a base pick. A provider-failed seat still follows the active profile's retry and substitution rule. Disclose a dropout and continue with the remaining adversaries.

## Verify

Verify each finding per arena Phase F by rerunning its command. Keep a finding when the output shows the failure and the failure breaks the intent. Drop the rest. Merge findings that share a root cause.

Skip arena Phases C, D, and E. Adversaries find different failures, so the verdict keeps every verified finding, not one adversary's list.

## Output

- **Intent**: the restatement.
- **Findings**: for each verified finding, the command, its output, how it breaks the intent, and the adversaries that found it. Say "no verified findings" when none survive.
- **Dropped**: for each adversary, the count of dropped findings and why.
